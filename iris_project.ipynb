    "This notebook provides a step by step analysis of the renowned Iris dataset, offering a comprehensive guide for analyzing its various dimensions with Python. In addition, the content provided in this notebook aims to clearly explain each of the scripts created in Python for this analysis as well as the modules and functions used.     \n",
    "It takes users through a structured journey, starting with dataset loading and basic exploration, progressing to understanding variable types and modeling techniques. Subsequent sections delve into categorical data analysis and exploration of numerical variables via summary statistics and histograms. Then, further sections explore with scatterplots and heat map the relationship between the variables and ends with a program that prints the results of a correlation analysis carried out between each two variables of the dataset.       \n",
    "This systematic approach empowers users to grasp the dataset's intricacies and relationships, thereby aiding informed analysis and decision-making in relevant research or applications."
