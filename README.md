This repository contains my Project for the module Programming and Scripting in ATU.


A demonstration repository to learn from Principles of Data Analytics class.
This README has been written with [Github's documentation on READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind.
You should refer to that documentation for more information on writing an appropriate README for visitors to your repository.
